## Blackjack Simulator

The first part of this project is a CLI-based blackjack table with you as the player and the environment as the dealer.

After you've cloned the repository and head into the root directory, simply run:

```bash
python blackjack_env.py
```

Have fun and may you only ever win (statistically not probable)!

## Future Work

The rest of the project is under construction. Eventually, the project will simulate episodes of blackjack games! All you need to do in the end is enter the game, then cheat and ask the model which action to take, and drown in wins (probably still not statistically possible). Stay tuned!
